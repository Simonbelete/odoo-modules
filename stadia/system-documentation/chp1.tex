Enterprise Resource Planning. An ERP is a generic software that is flexible to any modification
and customize and fulfills generic needs. Odoo is a modular system where its services are
represented as modules, and the ones that are necessary come installed with the ERP and can be

\section{System Requirements}

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}

Odoo is an undemanding system. For 5-employee companies, a 2 CPU 2 RAM server would be enough (recommended 8 RAM), raising to 4 CPU 8 RAM for 20 employees. We would recommend splitting application and database servers for 90 employees. Load balancing (LB) of application server would be needed for a company of 250+ employees.
