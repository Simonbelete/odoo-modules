\subsection{System Requirement Specification}

General structure of a user story described in this document: 
\\ \\
\begin{normalsize}
\textbf{\{User story name\}}: As a \{role\}, I want \{goal\}, so that \{benefit\} (\{priority\}).
\end{normalsize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The following sections describe the data required and the functional requirements that shall be performed in the new ERP System for both the HQ and field-based staffs.  These functional requirements include the on-going System maintenance and the creation and management reports for all areas.

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

\section{System Requirement Analysis}

\subsection{Actor and Use Case Identification}
A use case diagram is a graphic depiction of the interactions among the elements of a system. A use case is a methodology used in the system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements in this context, the term \"system" refers to something being developed or operated such as a mail-order product sales and service website. Use case diagram are employed in UML (Unified Modeling Language). A standard notation for the modeling of real-world object and systems. System objectives can include planning overall requirements validating a hardware design, testing and debugging a software product under development, creating an online help reference, or performing a consumer-service oriented task. For example, use case in a product sales environment would include item ordering, catalog updating payment processing, and customer relations. A use case diagram contains four components.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}

Use case diagrams are used during the analysis
process to find system requirements and to design
system functionality. In this study use case
diagrams are used to describe the access rights of
each actor. Administrator Actors generally have a
function to manage users such as creating accounts
and setting access rights.
